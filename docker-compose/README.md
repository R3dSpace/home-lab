# üê≥ Docker & Docker-Compose
The food for the whale is called Docker-Compose. Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application‚Äôs services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Install Docker & Docker-Compose
To install Docker & Docker-Compose we will be using the Docker *convenience script*. For more information visit the Docker [website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Run the following command's to start the installation process.

```bash

```

Test the installation of Docker & Docker-Compose, by running the following commands.
