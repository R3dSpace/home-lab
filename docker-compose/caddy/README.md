# xCaddy with Cloudfalre plugin

## About Caddy
Caddy simplifies your infrastructure. It takes care of TLS certificate renewals, OCSP stapling, static file serving, reverse proxying, Kubernetes ingress, and more.
Its modular architecture means you can do more with a single, static binary that compiles for any platform.
Caddy runs great in containers because it has no dependenciesâ€”not even libc. Run Caddy practically anywhere.
